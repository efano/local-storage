# Data Collecting Utilizing Local Storage and Geolocation

This Street Food Tracker web application collects data input by having the user click on a location on the map and then filling out a data input form. The submitted data is then stored in the browser via the [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) property which allows the app to save key-value pairs within the web browser. These data will persist even after the browser window is closed. The application also utilizes the [Geolocation API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation_API) which automatically orients the basemap near the user's physical location.
